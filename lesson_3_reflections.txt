- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	If you're working on a project from a different machine, or working on a project with multiple people.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You don't want to have git automatically pull changes while you are working on a new feature because this could break your code. You want to be able to decide when you want to pull so that you aren't in the middle of writing code.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A clone is a copy of the repository on your local disk which still points to the original source of the original creator. A Fork is a copy of the repository on your own github which is its own master. A branch is a new path of commits for experimental features and stuff.

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	If you go offline for a while you have the most recent repository available to you. 

- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Using dropbox and email or file sharing websites. Github would be a lot easier since you're able to work on the same thing simultaniously without having to wait for another person to finish their section first.
